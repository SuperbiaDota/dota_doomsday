# Dota Doomsday
The goal of this project is to rework mechanics from "new" Dota so that they follow the original spirit of the game. More specifically, everything in Dota should have identity, context, and agency.

Identity means that everything in dota is defined. A thing has certain properties that it must adhere to, and if those properties change it must be in a logical, predictable manner. Some examples of things that undermine identity include talents and aghanim's upgrades.

Context means that things in dota share certain properties with each other. This is what allows dota to be understood as a whole rather than a collection of individual pieces. Some examples of things that undermine context include talents and neutral items.

Agency means that you are responsible for the consequences of your actions. Some examples of things that undermine agency include neutral items and comeback gold.

Here are the ways I will try to accomplish this:
1. Remove all inconsistencies and rework existing mechanics so they are less prone to inconsistencies (rubick, creep-heroes)
2. Remove all free net worth mechanics
3. Rework talents and aghanim's upgrades to behave more like regular skill points
4. Rework neutral items to behave more like regular items

Current plans for reworking talents and aghanim's upgrades are to reduce the number of talents to 5. Every 5 levels starting at level 10, you choose one of 5 talents. Each talent modifies one of the hero's base abilities. There is no required order so you can just choose the one you want. Aghanim's scepter gives you an extra skillpoint to select an additional talent. Max level is 25. Bonus abilities granted by aghanim's scepter are completely removed. If there is an interesting bonus ability I will instead add it to the base hero.

Current plans for reworking neutral items are to change to a crafting system. Instead of completed items, neutrals now have a chance to drop materials. The types of materials do not change with game time and there is no limit to how many can drop besides the rate at which camps spawn. Materials can be combined with items from the shop to make more powerful items. In general, any item that is an upgrade of a powerful early-game item will be locked behind crafting (bloodthorn, wraith pact, helm of the overlord). Certain materials only drop from certain areas so you must control those areas to get the item you want.
