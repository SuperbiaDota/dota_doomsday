diff:
frost arrows now freeze after 5 consecutive attacks on the same enemy

marksmanship is now a basic aura ability, granting bonus attack range and attack speed to allied ranged heroes and being disabled if an enemy is within 400 units
marksmanship grants agility instead of attack speed to drow herself

drow's ultimate is piercing shot, a projectile that travels for 1.5x her attack range and is destroyed upon the first enemy hit
piercing shot deals damage the farther the target is away from drow and deals bonus damage based on her agility
piercing shot ignores base armor against frozen enemies
