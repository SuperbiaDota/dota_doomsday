random blood particle effects?

SYSTEM MECHANICS

str: now gives +0.33 bonus damage

new ability: mana burst - costs percentage of max mana

0.3 second startup, gain damage resistance and apply slow aura while channeling
at the end of channel become disarmed, muted, silenced

no general cast range modification
reasons:
some spells have unusual behavior with cast range (abilities that gain width the farther they travel)
lots of spells dont work with cast range

dawnbreaker starbreaker
mars gods rebuke
primal beast onslaught
phoenix icarus dive
drow multishot
hoodwink sharpshooter
invoker meatball (affects the meatball travel distance?)
monkey king boundless strike
vector targeting doesn't increase the range of the second cast (this makes sense to me)

change all abilities to work with status resistance
status resistance updates dynamically
DoT damage is reduced by status resistance

movement does not require turning (is this good or not?)

most roots deal small damage and issue a stop command when applied

remove:
break
general cast range modification
lifesteal amplification
regen amplification
spell lifesteal amplification
immediate cast point
cast while channeling

limited availability:
spell amp (kaya, doesnt stack)
spell lifesteal (bloodstone active, costs charges)
percentage-based spell damage
heal restoration modification

TODO:
send craft duration to client
create events for selection, update craft ui depending on what unit is selected
dont let players craft items not owned by them
highlight craft components on hover
radial talents pentagram menu
make burst cost percentage of max mana, if cost can't be afforded then lose all mana and don't apply aura slow
do towers not have backdoor?
material drops have peusdo random per creep camp (and maybe so theres less duplicate drops?)
teams arent named radiant and dire for some reason
outgoing spell amp is additive, should be multiplicative
normal casting autocast attack modifiers aggro creeps

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SETTINGS

TODO:
auto-repeat attack move
force ground-targeted
only target heroes?
add new modifier keys
auto attack on/off in scoreboard
option for right click doesnt attack
fix select ally hero hotkeys; rearrange scoreboard
drag item to ground now drops item directly at hero's feet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

HERO CONCEPTS

meepo: clones equip all items used by main meepo but they are muted

new hero: gunslinger (adds some cool mechanics from league that i think could work in dota)

Innate - Reload
gunslinger loads 6 bullets into his revolver

Q - Bull's eye
gunslinger shoots in a line, connecting with the first enemy
can pierce a limited number of enemies
deals physical damage as a multiplier of gunslinger's attack damage and deals bonus damage based on the target's missing health
Must have revolver equipped to cast, range is equal to double gunslinger's attack range

W - ?
Autocast fires gunslinger's revolver, becoming ranged and gaining bonus damage but significantly increasing his BAT. The less bullets there are in the chamber the more damage is dealt

E - Combat roll
Gunslinger rolls in the target direction. Does not require turning. Gains phase but cannot pass over terrain. Disjoints projectiles

R - Bullet time
Passive: When gunslinger gets a kill he chambers a bullet and refreshes the cooldowns of his basic abilities
can be cast to equip two guns, increasing gunslinger's clip size to 12, reducing his BAT, and allowing him to attack without turning
bullet time ends if gunslinger reloads or runs out of bullets

Talents:
1. Bull's eye gains two charges for the duration of bullet time
2. bonus ace in the hole damage
3. become invisible for the duration of combat roll
4. Casting bullet time procs the passive
5. Bonus revolver attack range
